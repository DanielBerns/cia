Ownership of major industrial and mining facilities  is divided among private interests--including several multinationals--and  the government. Most large agricultural holdings are private, with the  government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts between large  landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent violence.  The government is seeking an IMF standby loan despite several failed  agreements over the past decade. Relations with foreign commercial  banks remain strained because of mounting interest arrears on Brazil's  long-term debt. The Collor government, which assumed office in March  1990, is embarked on an ambitious reform program that seeks to  modernize and reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices,  deregulating the economy, and opening it to increased foreign  competition.

To this end the authorities have switched to a system of household  responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization,  increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in  industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services  and light manufacturing, and opened the foreign economic sector to  increased trade and joint ventures. The most gratifying result has been a  strong spurt in production, particularly in agriculture in the early  1980s.

The  government currently is encouraging foreign investment in tourist  facilities. Other investment priorities include sugar, basic foods, and  nickel. The annual $4 billion Soviet subsidy, a main prop to Cuba's  threadbare economy, is likely to show a substantial decline over the  next few years in view of the USSR's mounting economic problems. Instead  of highly subsidized trade, Cuba will be shifting to trade at market  prices in convertible currencies.

Its industry, transport, energy  sources, banking, and most other means of production are state owned. The  country is deficient, however, in energy and in many raw materials.  Moreover, its aging capital plant lags well behind West European  standards. Industry contributes almost 50% to GNP and construction  contributes 10%. About 95% of agricultural land is in collectives or  state farms. The centrally planned economy has been tightly linked in  trade (80%) to the USSR and Eastern Europe. Growth has been sluggish,  averaging less than 2% in the period 1982-89. GNP per capita is the  highest in Eastern Europe.

Its main economic force is the manufacturing sector--principally  the wood, metals, and engineering industries. Trade is important, with  the export of goods representing about 30% of GDP. Except for timber and  several minerals, Finland depends on imported raw materials, energy, and  some components of manufactured goods. Because of the climate,  agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in  basic commodities. The economy, which experienced an average of 4.9%  annual growth between 1987 and 1989, leveled off in 1990 and is now  in a recession facing negative growth in 1991.

Western Germany has an advanced market economy  and is a leading exporter. It experienced faster-than-projected real  growth largely because of demand in eastern Germany for western German  goods. Western Germany has a highly urbanized and skilled population  which enjoys excellent living standards, abundant leisure time, and  comprehensive social welfare benefits. Western Germany is relatively  poor in natural resources, coal being the most important mineral.  Western Germany's world-class companies manufacture technologically  advanced goods.

Mitsotakis inherited several  severe economic problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker  governments, which neglected the runaway budget deficit, a ballooning  current account deficit, and accelerating inflation.

The economy has been dominated by the oil sector,  which has provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s  financial problems, caused by massive expenditures in the eight-year  war with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran, led the  government to implement austerity measures and to borrow heavily and  later reschedule foreign debt payments. After the end of hostilities in  1988, oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new  pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities. Agricultural development  remained hampered by labor shortages, salinization, and dislocations  caused by previous land reform and collectivization programs. The  industrial sector, although accorded high priority by the government,  also was under financial constraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August  1990, subsequent international economic embargoes, and military actions  by an international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically  changed the economic picture.

It depends on imports for crude oil, food, grains, raw  materials, and military equipment. Despite limited natural resources,  Israel has developed its agricultural and industrial sectors on an  intensive scale over the past 20 years. Industry accounts for about 23%  of the labor force, agriculture for 5%, and services for most of the  balance. Diamonds, high-technology machinery, and agricultural products  (fruits and vegetables) are the biggest export earners. The balance of  payments has traditionally been negative, but is offset by large transfer  payments and foreign loans. About half of Israel's $18 billion external  government debt is owed to the US, which is its major source for economic  and military aid. To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel must continue  to exploit high-technology niches in the international market, such as  medical scanning equipment. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on 2 August dealt  a blow to Israel's economy in 1990. Higher world oil prices added an  estimated $300 million to Israel's 1990 oil import bill, and helped  keep the inflation rate at 18% for the year. Regional tensions  and continuing acts of the Palestinian uprising  (intifadah)-related violence contributed to a sharp dropoff in  tourism--a key source of foreign exchange--to the lowest level since the  1973 Arab-Israeli war.

In mid-1989, the Jordanian Government  agreed to implement an IMF austerity program designed to tackle the  country's serious economic problems. The program sought to gradually  reduce the government's budget deficit over the next several years and  implement badly needed structural reforms in the economy. In return for  agreeing to the IMF program, Jordan was granted IMF standby loans of over  $100 million. Recognizing that it would be unable to cover its debt  obligations, the government also began debt rescheduling negotiations  with creditors in mid-1989.

Family remittances,  foreign financial support to political factions, the narcotics trade, and  international emergency aid are main sources of foreign exchange.

Severe cutbacks in imports over the past five years have led to shortages  of basic goods and foodstuffs, although the reopening of the  Libyan-Tunisian border in April 1988 and the Libyan-Egyptian border in  December 1989 have somewhat eased shortages. Austerity budgets and a lack  of trained technicians have undermined the government's ability to  implement a number of planned infrastructure development projects.  Windfall profits from the hike in world oil prices in late 1990 improved  the foreign payments position and may permit Tripoli to ease austerity  measures. The nonoil industrial and construction sectors, which account  for about 22% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly agricultural  products to include petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Although  agriculture accounts for less than 5% of GNP, it employs 18% of the labor  force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm output,  requiring Libya to import about 75% of its food requirements.", "No key", "Inflation rate (consumer prices): 20% (1988 est.)", "Unemployment rate: 2% (1988 est.)", "Budget: revenues $8.1 billion; expenditures $9.8 billion, including  capital expenditures of $3.1 billion (1989 est.)", "Exports: $6.1 billion (f.o.b., 1989 est.);", "Imports: $6.2 billion (f.o.b., 1989 est.);", "External debt: $3.5 billion, excluding military debt (December  1990 est.)", "Industrial production: growth rate NA%; accounts for 43% of GDP  (including oil)", "Electricity: 4,705,000 kW capacity; 13,600 million kWh produced,  3,220 kWh per capita (1990)", "Industries: petroleum, food processing, textiles, handicrafts,  cement", "Agriculture: 5% of GNP; cash crops--wheat, barley, olives, dates,  citrus fruits, peanuts; 75% of food is imported", "No key", "Economic aid: Western (non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral  commitments (1970-87), $242 million; no longer a recipient", "Currency: Libyan dinar (plural--dinars);  1 Libyan dinar (LD) = 1,000 dirhams", "Exchange rates: Libyan dinars (LD) per US$1--0.2669 (January 1991),  0.2699 (1990), 0.2922 (1989), 0.2853 (1988), 0.2706 (1987), 0.3139  (1986), 0.2961 (1985)", "Fiscal year: calendar year", "No key", "Highways: 32,500 km total; 24,000 km bituminous and bituminous  treated, 8,500 km gravel, crushed stone and earth", "No key", "Pipelines: crude oil 4,383 km; natural gas 1,947 km; refined  products 443 km (includes 256 km liquid petroleum gas)", "Ports: Tobruk, Tripoli, Banghazi, Misratah, Marsa el Brega", "Civil air: 59 major transport aircraft", "Airports: 131 total, 123 usable; 53 with permanent-surface runways;  7 with runways over 3,659 m; 31 with runways 2,440-3,659 m; 44 with  runways 1,220-2,439 m", "Telecommunications: modern telecommunications system using radio  relay, coaxial cable, tropospheric scatter, and domestic satellite  stations; 370,000 telephones; stations--18 AM, 3 FM, 13 TV; satellite  earth stations--1 Atlantic Ocean INTELSAT, 1 Indian Ocean INTELSAT, and  14 domestic; submarine cables to France and Italy; radio relay to  Tunisia; tropospheric scatter to Greece; planned ARABSAT and Intersputnik  satellite stations", "Branches: Armed Peoples of the Libyan Arab Jamahariya (includes  Army, Navy, Air Force, Air Defense Command), National Police", "Manpower availability: males 15-49, 1,023,335; 603,886 fit for  military service; 52,059 reach military age (17) annually;  conscription now being implemented", "Defense expenditures: $NA, 11.1% of GNP (1987)", "5"

The US is Mexico's major trading partner, accounting for two-thirds of  its exports and imports. After petroleum, border assembly plants and  tourism are the largest earners of foreign exchange. The government, in  consultation with international economic agencies, is implementing  programs to stabilize the economy and foster growth.

In addition, the economy  must support a large military establishment and provide for the needs of  4 million Afghan refugees. A real economic growth rate averaging 5-6% in  recent years has enabled the country to cope with these problems. Almost  all agriculture and small-scale industry is in private hands, and the  government seeks to privatize a portion of the large-scale industrial  enterprises now publicly owned.

Agriculture,  including forestry, accounts for about 25% of GNP, employs about 45% of  the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. Paraguay has no known  significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large  hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined  compared with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an  average annual rate of nearly 11%.  During 1982-86 real GDP fell in three  of five years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and  foreign debt rose. Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the  economy were the completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather  for crops, and weak international commodity prices for agricultural  exports.
