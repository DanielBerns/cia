Agriculture nevertheless remains an important sector,  providing sizable export earnings and meeting domestic food needs.  Industry accounts for about 40% of GNP and 30% of employment. Nearly  three-fourths of foreign trade is with the USSR and Eastern Europe.  Low  rates of growth reflect the inability of the Soviet-style economy to  modernize capital plant and motivate workers.

The initial reforms featured greater authority for  enterprise managers over prices, wages, product mix, investment, sources  of supply, and customers. But in the absence of effective market  discipline, the result was the disappearance of low-price goods,  excessive wage increases, an even larger volume of unfinished  construction projects, and, in general, continued economic stagnation.  The Gorbachev regime has made at least four serious errors in economic  policy in these five years: the unpopular and short-lived anti-alcohol  campaign; the initial cutback in imports of consumer goods; the failure  to act decisively for the privatization of agriculture; and the buildup  of a massive overhang of unspent rubles in the hands of households and  enterprises. In October 1989, a top economic adviser, Leonid Abalkin  presented an ambitious but reasonable timetable for the conversion to a  partially privatized market system in the 1990s. In December 1989,  however, Premier Ryzhkov's conservative approach prevailed, namely, the  contention that a period of retrenchment was necessary to provide a  stable financial and legislative base for launching further reforms.  Accordingly, the new strategy was to put the reform process on hold in  1990-92 by recentralizing economic authority and to placate the  rank-and-file through sharp increases in consumer goods output. In still  another policy twist, the leadership in early 1990 was considering a  marked speedup in the marketization process. Because the economy is  caught in between two systems, there was in 1989 an even greater mismatch  between what was produced and what would serve the best interests of  enterprises and households.
